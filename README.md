# Calculating the Value of Pi

This repository shows approaches to calculate the value of pi in different
programing languages and parallelization schemes.

## Aim

The primary aim of the provided source codes is to showcase the different ways
of implementing a computation-heavy task in various programming languages.
Possible optimization and parallelization approaches shall be illustrated, but
peak performance is not of interest. Choosing the task of calculating the
value of pi has the benefit of being easily understood and verified.

## Requirements

The C++ code should be runnable on any system with a C++11 compiler.

It was tested with

* GCC 8.3.0 on Ubuntu 18.04
* MSVC 2019 on Windows 10 (1909)
